<ng-container *ngFor="let o of orderNumber">
  <div *ngIf="orderNumber.index<=4">
    <!-- struggling with these ngIf statements, should I be putting the logic somewhere else?
    the comparison tags (< and >) seem to be read as opening/closing tags within the HTML and it's throwing the whole thing off -->
    Order #{{o}}
